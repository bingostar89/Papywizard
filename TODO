? question

* Design
    + use Condition object to synchronize things
    x add a hardwareDriverFactory, and put driver type in config
    + implement a Scan class for shooting
    + unit tests
    + add sub-loggers (model, view, hardware...)
    + use python config parser module for global configuration
    ? use gtkmvc framework
    x remove Tkinter support
    + implement a statusbarManager to display messages (during a given time)
    + use message window for harware connexion...
    
* View
    ? Group manual move and shoot dialogs?
    
    * MainWindow
        * menus
            x read current position
            x define zero (offset)
            x 'about' entry
        x lock window close while a sub-dialog is open
        x add visual status for hardware connection (grey/green led). Gtk version only
        x add visual feedback for hardware com. (blinking green led)
        x add coords in realtime (just implement slot connected to spy)
        + deactivate menu if real hardware is unusable (lib dependency problem)
        + use status line and message box
        
    * ManualMoveDialog
        x add stop button (for 'home'). Feature removed.
        x refresh postion in real time
        x add 'Set' buttons for start/end pos
        + add 'Goto Start', 'Goto End' and 'Goto Previous' buttons
        x add entries for yaw/pitch position to reach
        x when click on home button, pos and 3D view are not update (spy problem). Feature removed.
        
    * ShootDialog
        x add progressbar
        x refresh postion in real time
        + compute estimated time
        + add 'Simul.' checkbox
        x stop shooting if window is closed (can't close while shooting)
        x stop does not work while moving
        
    * ConfigDialog
        x recompute all params when closing

* View3D
    + add view from the camera (with correct fov)
    + refresh fov and other params
    x last pos seems to be missed
    x bad position while switching from real hardware to simul
    + add yaw/pitch display
    + show/hide 3D view (done but bug under linux)
    + show/hide all params representation (lens fov, total fov, pos...)

* Model
    x implement delay param
    x allow connect/disconnect from hardware (switch from simulation to real hardware)
    + add try/except arround all hardware calls
    + save preferences as soon as a param changes
    + move preferences loading out of model (to main script)
    + add choice to either use hardware panohead to shoot, or tetled usb toolkit
    + correct bug if start pos > end pos

* Hardware
    - rotation directions must be revisited
    + implement new drive method for small moves (faster)
    x better import of serial module

* Misc
    + add soft limits to avoid camera/lens collisions
    + backlash correction
    + doc!!!!
    x export data (xml) for APP (from Scan)
    + add license header in files
    + add a log viewer
