INTRO

papywizard (PAnormaic PYthon WIZARD) is a python software to drive the Merlin/Orion
astronomic head, in order to turn it into a panoramic head. See:

    http://www.autopano.net/wiki/action/view/Orion_TeleTrack_altazimuth_tracking_mount

MVC (Model-View-Controller) pattern is used to make things more modular.
Current version of papywizard uses Tkinter as GUI, but other toolkits can be
used without too much modifications.

Tkinter has been chosen because it exists on all plateforms, including PocketPC,
through PythonCE port, which will be used as remote-controller.

USAGE

There is no available documentation yet. But the GUI is simple, and should be
easy to use for pano photographers.

LICENSES

papywizard is released under CeCILL license.

Enjoy!
