INTRO

papywizard (PAnormaic PYthon WIZARD) is a python software to drive the Merlin/Orion
astronomic head, in order to turn it into a panoramic head. See:

MVC (Model-View-Controller) pattern is used to make things more modular.
Current version of papywizard uses Tkinter ang pygtk as GUI, but other toolkits can be
used without too much modifications.

Tkinter has first been chosen because it exists on all plateforms, including PocketPC,
through PythonCE port, which can be used as remote-controller. But it does not work well
on PPC (at least, in seems to need a lot of modifications). But Gtk version works
out-of-the-box on both normal linux PC and Nokia Tablet Internet!

USAGE

There is no available documentation yet. But the GUI is simple, and should be
easy to use for pano photographers.

LICENSES

papywizard is released under CeCILL license.
