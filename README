INTRO

panohead (find another name!) is a python software to drive the Merlin/Orion
astronomic head, in order to turn it into a panoramic head. See:

    http://fr.wiki.autopano.net/T%C3%AAte_astronomique_Multi-fonctions_Merlin

MVC (Model-View-Controller) pattern is used to make things more modular.
Current version of Panohead uses Tkinter as GUI, but other toolkits can be
used without too much modifications.

Tkinter has been chosen because it exists on all plateforms, including PocketPC,
through PythonCE port, which will be used as remote-controller.

USAGE

There is no available documentation yet. But the GUI is simple, and should be
easy to use for pano photographers.

NOTES

panohead is released under CeCILL license.

Enjoy!
